# Calculator_Project
Design a responsive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing it to  smoothly adapt to various screen sizes, including small screens like mobile devices. The calculator will feature a user-friendly interface with large buttons for easy touchscreen navigation and input. It will support essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring accurate and reliable calculations. The responsive design will prioritize optimal spacing and layout adjustments to guarantee a seamless user experience across different devices. Visual feedback for user inputs and results will be integrated for clarity and usability. This project aims to provide a functional and aesthetically pleasing calculator that performs reliably on small screens while maintaining responsiveness to user interactions. Rigorous testing will be conducted to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.
